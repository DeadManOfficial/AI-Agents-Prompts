## FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES

### Example Input 1: Video Transcript

```
<user>
Multiply this video transcript:

"What's up everyone. So I've been doing YouTube for 3 years and I finally cracked the code on getting views. Here's the thing nobody tells you - it's not about the algorithm, it's about the first 3 seconds.

I analyzed my top 50 videos and the pattern was insane. Every single one had a hook that created what I call 'incomplete curiosity' - you give them PART of something but not the whole thing.

For example, instead of saying 'How to get more views' you say 'The YouTube mistake that cost me 100,000 views.' See the difference? One is complete, one is incomplete. Your brain NEEDS to close that loop.

The second thing? Pattern interrupts. Every 3 seconds, something needs to change. A cut, a zoom, text on screen, a sound effect. Our attention spans are fried. If you're not interrupting the pattern, you're losing viewers.

Third - and this is the big one - stop making videos about what YOU want to talk about. Start making videos that answer questions people are ALREADY searching for. I use a tool to find these, happy to share in the comments.

Anyway, that's it. Hook, interrupts, and search demand. Master these three and watch what happens. Peace."

## 7. TWITTER/X THREAD
**Platform:** X/Twitter
**Format:** 8-tweet thread

**Tweet 1 (Standalone Hook):**
I analyzed my top 50 YouTube videos.

Every single one had 3 things in common.

Here's the framework that changed everything: 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
1/ THE HOOK (First 3 seconds)

Stop thinking "catchy title."
Start thinking "incomplete curiosity."

❌ "How to get more views"
✓ "The mistake that cost me 100K views"

One is complete. One creates a loop your brain NEEDS to close.

**Tweet 3:**
2/ PATTERN INTERRUPTS (Every 3 seconds)

Your viewer's attention span is fried. So is yours.

Every 3 seconds, something must change:
- Camera cut
- Zoom
- Text overlay
- Sound effect

No interrupt = viewer gone.

**Tweet 4:**
3/ SEARCH DEMAND

Brutal truth: Nobody cares what you want to talk about.

They care about THEIR problems.

Make content that answers questions people are already searching for.

Your passion + their demand = growth.

**Tweet 5:**
The math is simple:

• Hook stops the scroll
• Interrupts keep attention
• Search demand brings volume

Master these 3, ignore everything else.

**Tweet 6:**
The mistake I see most?

Creators who nail ONE of these but ignore the others.

Great hook + boring video = drop-off
Great video + no search demand = crickets
Search demand + weak hook = never clicked

You need all 3.

**Tweet 7:**
Want to find what people are searching for?

Reply "SEARCH" and I'll share my exact process.

**Tweet 8:**
TL;DR:

1. Incomplete curiosity hooks
2. Pattern interrupt every 3 sec
3. Answer existing search demand

That's it. That's the framework.

# How to Get More Views on YouTube: The 3-Part Framework I Discovered After Analyzing 50 Videos

**Meta Description:** Discover the 3-part framework for YouTube growth: incomplete curiosity hooks, pattern interrupts, and search demand. Based on analysis of 50 top-performing videos.

---

After 3 years on YouTube and analyzing my top 50 performing videos, I found a pattern that changed everything. It wasn't about gaming the algorithm or posting more frequently. It came down to three specific elements that every successful video shared.

Here's the framework.

## The Problem With Most YouTube Advice

You've heard it all before: "Just be consistent." "Post quality content." "Engage with your audience."

None of that is wrong. It's just incomplete.

I was consistent for two years and still struggled. The breakthrough came when I stopped focusing on the algorithm and started focusing on human psychology.

Specifically, three aspects of it.

## Part 1: The Incomplete Curiosity Hook

Your first 3 seconds determine whether someone watches or scrolls. But most creators get hooks completely wrong.

They think hooks are about being "catchy" or "clickbaity." They're not.

**Hooks are about creating incomplete curiosity.**

Here's what I mean:

- ❌ **Complete:** "How to get more views on YouTube"
- ✅ **Incomplete:** "The YouTube mistake that cost me 100,000 views"

The first example is complete. Your brain processes it and moves on. There's no open loop.

The second example is incomplete. Your brain registers: "What mistake? I need to know." That's an open loop. Your viewer's brain *needs* to close it.

### How to Create Incomplete Curiosity

1. **Tease the outcome, hide the method:** "How I gained 10K subscribers" → "The weird trick that got me 10K subscribers in 30 days"

2. **Imply a mistake or problem:** "What most creators get wrong about..."

3. **Create specificity without completion:** "The 3-second rule that changed my YouTube game" (What rule? Tell me.)

4. **Use numbers with gaps:** "I tested 50 thumbnails. Only 3 worked." (Which 3?)

Every one of these creates a loop that demands closure.

## Part 2: Pattern Interrupts Every 3 Seconds

Here's an uncomfortable truth: your viewer's attention span is destroyed. So is mine. So is yours.

We've been conditioned by TikTok, Reels, and Shorts to expect constant stimulation. If you're not providing it, you're losing viewers.

**The solution: Pattern interrupts every 3 seconds.**

A pattern interrupt is anything that changes the visual or audio landscape:

- Camera angle change
- Zoom in or out
- Text appearing on screen
- Sound effect
- B-roll footage
- Graphics or animations

When I analyzed my top-performing videos, this was the clearest pattern. The videos that held attention had *something* changing every 2-4 seconds. The videos that lost viewers were static talking-head shots that went 10+ seconds without variation.

### Practical Implementation

1. **Plan interrupts during scripting:** Mark every 3 seconds where something will change
2. **Multiple camera angles:** Even if it's the same camera, punch in/out creates variation
3. **Strategic text:** Emphasize key words with on-screen text
4. **Sound design:** Whooshes, clicks, and subtle effects maintain engagement

This isn't about being gimmicky. It's about respecting how human attention works in 2024.

## Part 3: Search Demand Over Personal Passion

This is where I have to deliver some tough love.

Nobody cares what you want to talk about.

I know that sounds harsh. But the sooner you accept it, the faster you'll grow.

**People search for solutions to THEIR problems, not YOUR interests.**

The shift that changed my channel: I stopped asking "What do I want to make?" and started asking "What are people already searching for?"

### Finding Search Demand

1. **YouTube Search Bar:** Start typing your topic and see what autocompletes
2. **Competitor Analysis:** What videos are working in your niche?
3. **Comment Mining:** What questions do people ask on popular videos?
4. **Google Trends:** Is search volume increasing or decreasing?

### The Sweet Spot

The goal isn't to abandon your passion. It's to find the intersection:

**Your Passion + Audience Demand = Sustainable Growth**

I'm passionate about content strategy. People search for "how to get more views." By making content about my passion that answers their search, I win on both fronts.

## The Complete Framework

Let's bring it together:

1. **Hook:** Create incomplete curiosity in the first 3 seconds
2. **Retention:** Pattern interrupt every 3 seconds throughout
3. **Discovery:** Make content that answers existing search demand

That's it. Three elements.

The mistake I see most creators make? They nail one and ignore the others.

- Great hook + boring video = massive drop-off
- Great video + no search demand = crickets
- Search demand + weak hook = never clicked

You need all three working together.

## Implementation Checklist

Before publishing your next video, ask:

**Hook Check:**
- [ ] Does my title create incomplete curiosity?
- [ ] Do my first 3 seconds create an open loop?
- [ ] Would I click on this if I saw it in my feed?

**Retention Check:**
- [ ] Is something changing every 3 seconds?
- [ ] Do I have varied camera angles/zooms?
- [ ] Is text reinforcing key points on screen?

**Demand Check:**
- [ ] Are people actually searching for this topic?
- [ ] What keywords am I targeting?
- [ ] Does my title include searchable terms?

## Final Thoughts

I spent 2 years thinking YouTube was about the algorithm. It's not.

It's about psychology. Hook the brain, maintain attention, answer real questions.

Master these three elements and watch what happens.

Hey,

I've been holding onto something.

A framework I discovered after analyzing my top 50 YouTube videos. I finally wrote it up, and I wanted you to have it first.

Here's the short version:

**1. Incomplete Curiosity**

Stop saying "How to get more views."
Start saying "The mistake that cost me 100K views."

One is complete. Your brain processes and moves on.
One is incomplete. Your brain NEEDS the answer.

That's your hook.

**2. Pattern Interrupts**

Something needs to change every 3 seconds in your content. A cut, a zoom, text on screen, a sound effect. Anything.

Our attention spans are fried. Respect that reality.

**3. Search Demand**

Harsh truth: nobody cares what you want to talk about. They care about their problems.

Find what people are already searching for. Make content that answers those questions.

Your passion + their demand = growth.

---

That's it. Three things.

I spent 2 years thinking it was about "the algorithm." It's not. It's about human psychology.

Hook the brain. Maintain attention. Answer real questions.

Reply and let me know your biggest takeaway. I read every response.

Talk soon,
[Name]

P.S. - I'm thinking about doing a deeper breakdown on each of these three. Want it? Just reply "YES" and I'll prioritize it.

## 11. COUNTER-TAKE
**Platform:** X/Twitter, TikTok
**Format:** Controversial opinion

**Twitter Version:**

Unpopular opinion:

"Follow your passion" is the worst advice for content creators.

Your passion doesn't pay bills. Search demand does.

Find what people are ALREADY looking for.
Make content that answers those questions.
Inject YOUR personality into it.

That's the formula.

"But that's selling out—"

No. That's strategy.

Picasso didn't paint whatever he wanted. He understood the market AND made great art.

You can do both.

**TikTok Script:**

[TEXT: "Hot take incoming"]

"Follow your passion is terrible advice for creators."

[PAUSE]

"I know, I know. Hear me out."

"Your passion doesn't get views. Search demand does."

[TEXT: "Search demand > passion"]

"But here's the move - find what people are ALREADY searching for, and inject YOUR passion into THAT."

"That's not selling out. That's strategy."

[TEXT: "Passion + Demand = Growth"]

"Picasso understood the market AND made great art. You can do both."

**CTA:** "Agree or disagree? Fight me in the comments."

---

## 12. FAQ EXPANSION
**Platform:** YouTube Community, Blog, Stories
**Format:** Q&A

**Q: Doesn't using hooks make my content clickbait?**
A: Clickbait is promising something you don't deliver. A hook is an invitation that you fulfill. "The mistake that cost me 100K views" is only clickbait if you never reveal the mistake. Incomplete curiosity + full delivery = effective hook, not clickbait.

**Q: What if my niche doesn't have search demand?**
A: Every niche has questions people are asking. You might need to reframe your content around problems rather than topics. Instead of "My pottery journey" try "Why your pottery keeps cracking (and how to fix it)."

**Q: How do I add pattern interrupts without expensive equipment?**
A: You don't need equipment. Zoom in 20% on the same footage = new shot. Add text in editing = interrupt. Change your position slightly between takes = variation. Most pattern interrupts are editing choices, not gear choices.

**Q: What about authenticity? This feels formulaic.**
A: Formula is structure, not personality. A sonnet has strict rules - that didn't stop Shakespeare. Use the framework as scaffolding, fill it with your authentic voice and perspective.

**Q: How do I find what people are searching for?**
A: Start typing your topic in YouTube's search bar. Look at autocomplete. Look at your competitors' most-viewed videos. Read comments for questions. Use tools like VidIQ or TubeBuddy for data. The information is free.
